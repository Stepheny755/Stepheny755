## Hey, Stephen here ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in the intersection of software engineering and physical systems (mechatronics). I graduated from UofT in computer engineering, and I'm currently working through my masters in the Diller Lab with a focus on surgical microrobots. 

Previously, I worked on FPGA IP Development at Intel and at the UofT Multimedia on ML for computational pathology.

When I'm free, I enjoy brewing coffee (V60 and Moka), lifting rocks, 3D printing and reading. Feel free to reach out!
