## Hey, Stephen here ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

(he/him)

I'm a computer engineering student, avid reader, creative tinkerer, mountain hiker. 

### previously
from Vancouver, BC, where the mountains are tall and the skies are blue... most of the year. 

### currently
working on researching electromagnetic propulsion systems for hyperloop, as well as contributing to [IEEE UofT](https://github.com/ieeeuoft). Additionally, I'm learning about neural networks and other ML algorithms.

### hopefully
in the future I can use my engineering skills to make an impact in improving autonomous systems or creating efficient electromagnetics.
